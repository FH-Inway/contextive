# Ubictionary

Ubictionary is a project to support the ubiquitous use of a Ubiquitous Language on software projects following Domain Driven Design.

The project is just getting started, so there aren't a lot of details yet - if this project is of interest, get in touch or check back soon!

## Installation

It's expected that Ubictionary will be available via the Extension/Plugin Marketplaces of the various IDEs that will be supported.

## Contributing

As there isn't much here yet, pull requests won't have much to contribute against. If you have ideas for features or implementation, please open an issue to record your thoughts.

Key architectural decisions are tracked using ADRs (Architectural Decision Records) using the [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format.  ADRs can be found in the [docs/adr](docs/adr) folder.

Development is being done using [Visual Studio Code Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). After cloning the repository and opening in Visual Studio Code, choose the "Reopen in Container" option to work in the dev environment. See the Visual Studio Code documentation for more details on setting up your docker environment.

Further details to come.
